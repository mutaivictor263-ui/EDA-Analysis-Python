Efploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves summarizing and Understanding datasets to 
uncover patterns, trends, relationships and potential issues before applying modeling techniques.

This projects demonstrates how to perform EDA using python and popular data analysis linries such as Pandas, seaborn, Matplotlib and and numpy.

Pandas - data manipulations
Numpy - numerical operations
Matplotlib - basic data visualization
Seaborn - advanced statistical visualization
Jupyter notebook - interactive analysis
